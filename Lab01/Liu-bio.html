    <body>
        My name is Junyi Liu. I am a sophomore studying Information Mangement and Technology
        who is very interested in the field of IT Project Management. I have experienced in many 
        jobs that helped me to develop my professional and sales skills. While taking many high level courses 
        in Syracuse University, I also am involved with many clubs and organizations helping me to network and 
        develop my soft skills. I like to play basketball and travel in my free time. I studied abroad
        in my first semester of my freshman year.
