        <p>From building my first computer parts by parts at the age of 14 to developing software programming projects at Syracuse University, technology innovation has always been my passion. On my ongoing mission to harness the power of information to transform industries and shape a smarter, more connected world, I joined several programs traveling nationally and abroad to build professional relationships with alumni and corporate individuals. Gaining insights from experienced professionals through active listening enhances my comprehension of the modern information-driven world on a profound level. With a strong foundation in tech and a continuous thirst for knowledge, I'm eager to explore the endless possibilities of data management and technology innovation during my academic journey and professional career. </p>

            I love playing basketball with friends both casually and competitively. This is one of the activities where playing basketball acts as a form of therapy to my everyday life. I felt that I can drop everything in my mind whenever I am playing and just have fun.
